# MergeSort-Parallel-NoteBook
A implement for MergeSort parallel algorithm in python and evalueate it 
# This is parallel version of Merge sort 
### Merge sort is a population sort method that have time complexity is O($nlogn$) in any case.
but today, i decide to boost it, and check how fast merge sort can reach with parrallel version and maybe our mergesort can win quick sort, who knows. 

All instruction i wrote down follow notebook, so you can find how it implemented with python and its efficiency
